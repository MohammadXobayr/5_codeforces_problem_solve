1 - Given two numbers A and B. Print "Yes" if A is greater than or equal to B. Otherwise print "No".
Input
Only one line containing two numbers A and B (0  ≤  A, B  ≤  100).
Output
Print "Yes" or "No" according to the statement.

2 - Given two numbers A and B. Print "Multiples" if A is multiple of B or vice versa. Otherwise print "No Multiples".
Input
Only one line containing two numbers A, B (1  ≤  A, B  ≤  106)
Output
Print the "Multiples" or "No Multiples" corresponding to the read numbers.

3 - Given a letter X. If the letter is lowercase print the letter after converting it from lowercase letter to uppercase letter. Otherwise print the letter after converting it from uppercase letter to lowercase letter
Note : difference between 'a' and 'A' in ASCII is 32 .
Input
Only one line containing a character X which will be a capital or small letter.
Output
Print the answer to this problem.

4 - Given a number X. Print "EVEN" if the first digit of X is even number. Otherwise print "ODD".
For example: In 4569 the first digit is 4, the second digit is 5, the third digit is 6 and the fourth digit is 9.
Input
Only one line containing a number X (999 < X  ≤  9999)
Output
If the first digit is even print "EVEN" otherwise print "ODD".

5 - Given a letter X. Determine whether X is Digit or Alphabet and if it is Alphabet determine if it is Capital Case or Small Case.
Output
Print a single line contains "IS DIGIT" if X is digit otherwise, print "ALPHA" in the first line followed by a new line that contains "IS CAPITAL" if X is a capital letter and "IS SMALL" if X is a small letter.

6 - Given 3 numbers A, B and C, Print the minimum and the maximum numbers.
Input
Only one line containing 3 numbers A, B and C ( - 105 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 105)
Output
Print the minimum number followed by a single space then print the maximum number.
